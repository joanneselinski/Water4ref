For design purposes, we moved save/cancel notifications to the bottom of the
screen as is makes more sense for these buttons to appear below a change that
has been made as opposed to above.

For conversion from ml to ounces, because we display as integers, when
units are switched and switched back, the rounding changes the numbers a little
but

Logic behind daily reset:
In settings, the Daily Reset resets at a certain hour the user’s water intake for the day.
All our logic for this is inside the checkResetIntake().
To test this, instead of waiting for whatever hour you set it to,
you can instead change the hour variable of the currentDate variable to what the hypothetically time would be
of a change and/or change the resetAt variable’s resetPref variable to be something else as well.
Logically, what this method does is turn the current time into an int and generates an int
for at what time that day the water tracker should reset and compares the two.
If the time it should reset at is less than the current time then it will rest
UNLESS, the last time the user logged it, it was already reset.
We save the last logged in time as an int in shared preferences
and reset it every onCreate and onResume
